# Trashgazing
! (In progress)

Web app that generates a projection of space debris coordinates from space-track.org.
Based on current position (defaults to downtown Montreal), it will grab all coordinates
of near- and medium-earth space debris and plot onto a circle based on compass coordinates. 
So, if you were to lie on your back, you would be able to view trash constellations and 
trash dwarf planets and trash asteroids in real-time. 

Written in Python/JS/WebGL for the 48 hour NASA Space Apps Hackathon 2018.
